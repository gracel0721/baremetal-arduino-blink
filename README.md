# baremetal-arduino-blink
Arduino Blink in Baremetal raw C programming 

Run ```make``` in the command line to run the makefile, then ```make deploy``` to deploy the code to your arduino

Note: I couldn't get the makefile to work in the VSCode command line, but If i run the commands indivivually in the command line terminal, this program works
